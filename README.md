# TimeSeries Repository

Inside this repository, I showcase my skills in solving Time Series problems. The exploration includes:

1. **Stationarity Analysis:** Determining whether the series is stationary or not using various procedures. This involves graphical analyses and different tests.

2. **Seasonality Detection:** Identifying if the series exhibits seasonality and, if so, determining the frequency at which seasonality occurs.

3. **Model Selection:** Determining the optimal model for estimation. This may involve using AutoARIMA or other types of analyses.

4. **Model Validation:** Ensuring that the estimated model is correct. This includes analyzing both predictions and residuals to validate the accuracy of the chosen model.

## Usage

Explore the code to see how I approach and evaluate Time Series forecasting with practical examples. The comparison between an AutoARIMA model and an ARIMA model is performed using indicators like RMSE, MSE, and MAE for evaluation.
