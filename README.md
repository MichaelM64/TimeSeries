Inside this repository, I showcase my skills in solving Time Series problems. The exploration includes:

**Stationarity Analysis:** Determining whether the series is stationary or not using various procedures. This involves graphical analyses and different tests. \
**Seasonality Detection:** Identifying if the series exhibits seasonality and, if so, determining the frequency at which seasonality occurs. \
**Model Selection: **Determining the optimal model for estimation. This may involve using AutoARIMA or other types of analyses. \
**Model Validation:** Ensuring that the estimated model is correct. This includes analyzing both predictions and residuals to validate the accuracy of the chosen model. \

The data used for this project is inside this repository.
